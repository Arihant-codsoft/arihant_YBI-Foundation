The project involves building a model that classifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The steps included data loading, preprocessing (normalization and reshaping), training a Random Forest model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The model demonstrates a strong ability to generalize, making it a viable solution for recognizing handwritten digits.
